# Algorithms-and-data-structures
My implementation of some algorithms and data structures.
### **Sorting**</br>
Implementation five sorting alghoritms: select sort, insert sort, heap sort, quick sort and modified version of quick sort which uses median of three values strategy and insertion sort for small enought number of elements.
### **Graphs**</br>
Implementation of Priority Queue based on binary heap with time complexity O(nlogn) for basic operations. Also, Dijkstra, Prim, Kruskal and Kosaraju algorithms based on my Priority Queue.
### **Trees**</br>
Implementation of: binary search tree, red black tree and splay tree.
### **Flow**</br>
Programs which count maximum flow in a hypercube of various dimensions and maximum matching of two disjoint vertex sets. Programs could also create linear programming model of those problems for glpk program.
